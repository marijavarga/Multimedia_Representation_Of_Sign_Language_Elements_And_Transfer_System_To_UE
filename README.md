# Multimedia_Representation_Of_Sign_Language_Elements_And_Transfer_System_To_UE

## Introduction

This system represents a good basis for further development of a system for translation and mediation in communication with hearing impaired people.
Recognizing hand movements and understanding what the movement means in real time is a major challenge in computer vision.
This project was implemented using Python programming language with OpenCV library and MediaPipe.
A system was created that detects the movement of the hand and interprets the meaning of the movement, and then transfers the movement to a 3D digital model of a hand in real time

## 

Detecting hand postion was done by using MediaPipe. Coordinates of 21 landmarks were passed to Unreal Engine and those movements were transfered on a digital 3D model.
